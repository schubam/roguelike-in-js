# Todo

## Worked on last

- update UI with entity changes after collision (right now after state update gold disappears, but player not there yet)
- use hero animations that are bigger than 16x16
- show enemies
- make rooms/maps procedurally
  - use patterns for ground
  - paint ground first, then walls
- combat (lose health)
