## Worked on last

I need to research the commands in rogue. I don't know what look does, for example.

## Step 3 - It's a boy!

- ~~display map characters~~
- display status lines
- display log messages
- ~~handle user input~~
- ~~make player walk around~~

## Step 4 - The map

- ~~display map~~
- ~~show player~~
- ~~scrolling of map~~
- ~~collide with walls~~
- look command
- open/close doors
